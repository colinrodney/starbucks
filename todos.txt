Figure out what course of action to take w/ jquery:

  > run from JavaScript when certain conditions present or just leave it enabled

  > Explore window.matchMedia() method (w3 schools/ MDN)

  > Work w/ dev starter kit@ codingphase.com (not related to this project.)

> @ page load jquery does not run

> jQuery runs only if the viewport width is less than 768px

  When width < 768 px:
    1. trigger jQuery
    2. Hide section elements
    3. Show section element toggle
